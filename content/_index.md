## Hello!

<div align="justify"><font style="font-size: 15px;">I am a machine learning Scientist at </font> <a href="https://simplisafe.com">Simplisafe</a>.</div>, I got my PhD at the</font>

<div align="justify"> I design, develop and evaluate NLP models in my research to study latent needs in the early stage of Engineering Design. I am also doing CV related research for my current work, be more specific including object detection and embeedding related study.  
I was advised by</font> <a href="https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/mohsen-moghaddam">Prof. Mohsen Moghaddam</a>.</div>

<div align="justify"><font style="font-size: 15px;">I am fascinated by how LLM oriented methodology, the specific tasks including Language modeling, sentiment analysis, text summarization and question anwsering could augement and accelerate the design concept generation in the early stage of the engineering design process. 
<br>
I believe the next era of LLM must be agentic based systems, My work in Flagship was building the agentic system for solving LLM halucination problems.
<br>
My PhD research focuses on questions at the intersection of Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), Aspect guided Text summarization (AGTS), Name entity recognition and Latent needs identification. 
It is mainly computational but in future I want to build bridges to various application domains such as hybrid human-machine interaction design system, new product development and implementing sustainable and resilient innovation strategies. I am also doing LLM-CV integration research in my work.</font></div>
<br>
<div align="justify"><font style="font-size: 15px;"> Previously, I graduated with a Master of Data Analytics Engineering with a certificate of Engineering Management from the college of Engineering, Northeastern University. I have also earned a Bachelor of Safety Engineering from China. I was working as a machine learning scientist in Flagship Pioneeing FL100 lab working on multi-agent system buildin, Now I am a machine learning scientist in Simplisafe. I am also the EX AI leader of <a href="https://liraglobal.com/">Lira</a>. I have worked more than 3 years in high tech industry and Engineering industry.
