 <a href="https://www.sail-nu.com/">(Sail) Lab</a><font style="font-size: 15px;"> at Northeastern University. 
 I design, develop and evaluate NLP models in my research to study latent needs in the early stage of Engineering Design. 
  I â€™m advised by</font> <a href="https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/moghaddam-mohsen/">Prof. Mohsen Moghaddam</a>.</div>

<div align="justify"><font style="font-size: 15px;">I am fascinated by how LLM oriented methodology, the specific tasks including Language modeling, sentiment analysis, text summarization and question anwsering could augement and accelerate the design concept generation in the early stage of the engineering design process. 
My research focuses on questions at the intersection of Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), Aspect guided Text summarization (AGTS), Name entity recognition and Latent needs identification. 
It is mainly computational but in future I want to build bridges to various application domains such as hybrid human-machine interaction design system, new product development and implementing sustainable and resilient innovation strategies.</font></div>

<div align="justify"><font style="font-size: 15px;"> Previously, I graduated with a Master of Data Analytics Engineering with a certificate of Engineering Management from the colloege of Engineering, Northeastern University. I have also earned a Bachelor of Safety Engineering from China University of Labor Relations, BeiJing, China. I am the AI leader of <a href="https://liraglobal.com/">Lira</a>. I have worked more than 2 years in high tech industry and Engineering industry.
