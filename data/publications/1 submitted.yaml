  abstract: "Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) enables a systematic 
  identification of user opinions on particular aspects, thus enhancing 
  the idea creation process in the initial stages of product/service design. 
  Attention-based large language models (LLMs) like T5 and GPT4 have proven 
  powerful in ABSA tasks. Yet, several key limitations remain, both regarding 
  the ABSA task and the capabilities of attention-based models. First, 
  existing research mainly focuses on relatively simpler ABSA tasks such 
  as aspect--based sentiment analysis, while the task of extracting aspect, 
  opinion, and sentiment in a unified model remains largely unaddressed. 
  Second, current ABSA tasks overlook implicit opinions and sentiments. Third, 
  most attention-based LLMs like BERT use position encoding in a linear 
  projected manner or through split-position relations in word distance 
  schemes, which could lead to relation biases during the training process. 
  This paper addresses these gaps by (1) creating a new annotated dataset 
  with five types of labels, including aspect, category, opinion, 
  sentiment, and implicit indicator (ACOSI), (2) developing a unified 
  model capable of extracting all five types of labels simultaneously 
  in a generative manner, and (3) designing a new position encoding method 
  in the attention-based model. (4) introduced a new benchmark based on 
  Rouge scoure that incorporate with design domain knowledge inside. The 
  numerical experiments conducted on a manually labeled dataset scraped 
  from three major e-Commerce retail stores for apparel and footwear products 
  demonstrate the performance, scalability, and potential of the framework 
  developed. The article concludes with recommendations for future research 
  on automated need finding and sentiment analysis for user-centered design."

  abstract: "Aspect-guided summarization focuses on extracting information 
  relevant to specific aspects from multiple documents. Unlike generic 
  summarization and entity-related summarization, aspect-guided summarization 
  differs in terms of granularity. In this paper, we introduce the SafetySum 
  dataset and safety concerns-guided double encoder transformer (SDT) model, 
  which specifically caters to aspect-guided summarization in the domain of 
  safety engineering problems. We thoroughly analyze existing methods and 
  demonstrate that both entity-centric summarization and controllable 
  summarization techniques fall short of effectively addressing the requirements 
  of aspect-guided summarization. To address this challenge, we experiment with 
  previous approaches that can be adapted to this task and prove our SDT is 
  state-of-the-art for this task. Our analysis underscores the difficulty of 
  this task and highlights the need for innovative solutions."

  abstract: "Eliciting informative user opinions from online reviews is a 
  key success factor for innovative product design and development. 
  The unstructured, noisy, and verbose nature of user reviews, 
  however, often complicate large-scale need finding in a format useful 
  for designers without losing important information. Recent advances in 
  abstractive text summarization have created the opportunity to systematically 
  generate opinion summaries from online reviews to inform the early stages 
  of product design and development. However, two knowledge gaps hinder the 
  applicability of opinion summarization methods in practice. First, there is 
  a lack of formal mechanisms to guide the generative process with respect to
  different categories of product attributes and user sentiments. Second, the 
  annotated training datasets needed for supervised training of abstractive  
  summarization models are often difficult and costly to create. This article 
  addresses these gaps by (1) devising an efficient computational framework 
  for abstractive opinion summarization guided by specific product attributes 
  and sentiment polarities, and (2) automatically generating a synthetic 
  training dataset that captures various degrees of granularity and polarity. 
  A hierarchical multi-instance attribute-sentiment inference model is 
  developed for assembling a high-quality synthetic dataset, which is utilized 
  to fine-tune a pretrained language model for abstractive summary generation. 
  Numerical experiments conducted on a large dataset scraped from three major 
  e-Commerce retail stores for apparel and footwear products indicate the 
  performance, feasibility, and potentials of the developed framework. Several 
  directions are provided for future exploration in the area of automated 
  opinion summarization for user-centered design."

  abstract: "Eliciting user needs for individual components and features 
  of a product or a service on a large scale is a key requirement for 
  innovative design. Synthesizing data as an initial discovery phase of a 
  design process is usually accomplished with a small number of participants, 
  employing qualitative research methods such as observations, focus groups, 
  and interviews. This leaves an entire swath of pertinent user behavior, 
  preferences, and opinions not captured. Sentiment analysis is a key enabler 
  for large-scale need finding from online user reviews generated on a regular 
  basis. A major limitation of current sentiment analysis approaches used in 
  design sciences, however, is the need for laborious labeling and annotation 
  of large review datasets for training, which in turn hinders their scalability 
  and transferability across different domains. This article proposes an 
  efficient and scalable methodology for automated and large-scale elicitation 
  of attribute-level user needs. The methodology builds on the state-of-the-art 
  pretrained deep language model, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations 
  from Transformers), with new convolutional net and named entity recognition 
  (NER) layers for extracting attribute, description, and sentiment words from 
  online user review corpora. The machine translation algorithm BLEU (BiLingual 
  Evaluation Understudy) is utilized to extract need expressions in the form of 
  predefined part-of-speech combinations (e.g., adjective–noun, verb–noun). 
  Numerical experiments are conducted on a large dataset scraped from a major 
  e-commerce retail store for apparel and footwear to demonstrate the 
  performance, feasibility, and potentials of the developed methodology."

  abstract: "Devising intelligent systems capable of identifying the 
  idiosyncratic needs of users at scale and translating them into 
  attribute-level design feedback and recommendations is a key prerequisite 
  for successful user-centered design processes. Recent studies show that 49% 
  of design firms lack systems and tools for monitoring external platforms, 
  and only 8% have adopted digital, data-driven approaches for new product 
  development despite acknowledging them as a high priority. The 
  state-of-the-art attribute-level sentiment analysis approaches based on 
  deep learning have achieved promising results; however, these methods pose 
  strict preconditions, require manually labeled data for training and 
  pre-defined attributes by experts, and only classify sentiments intro 
  predefined categories which have limited implications for designers. 
  This article develops a rule-based methodology for extracting and analyzing 
  the sentiment expressions of users on a large scale, from myriad reviews 
  available on social media and e-commerce platforms. The methodology further 
  advances current unsupervised attribute-level sentiment analysis approaches 
  by enabling efficient identification and mapping of sentiment expressions of 
  individual users onto their respective attributes. Experiments on a large 
  dataset scraped from a major e-commerce retail store for apparel and 
  indicate 74.3%–93.8% precision in extracting attribute-level sentiment 
  expressions of users and demonstrate the feasibility and potentials of 
  the developed methodology for large-scale need finding from user reviews."
